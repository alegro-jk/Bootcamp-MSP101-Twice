TWICE is a nine-member KPOP girl group under JYP Entertainment.
Formed through the reality show SIXTEEN, they debuted on October 20, 2015 with the mini album "The Story Begins".

The group comprises of Nayeon, Jeongyeon, Momo, Sana, Jihyo, Mina, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Tzuyu.
Four members have foreign blood: Sana, Momo and Mina are Japanese while Tzuyu is Taiwanese.
The main reason why the name was suggested Twice was that it was believed that the band would touch the hearts of people twice: once through ears and another by eyes.

They became very popular when they released the iconic song "Cheer Up". The popularity has gone up space high!
Then they released another song with the same structure as Cheer up; easy to follow killing part, repetitive chorus, bright/positive energy, and a fun music video.
